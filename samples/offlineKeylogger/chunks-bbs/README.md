### Splitter Output - Offline Keylogger

You may use the files in this directory as the output of splitter in BBS mode.

#### Important Notes:
1. Note that the chunks are created from executable built in debug mode.
Please make sure that the stand-alone  malware (`../main.cpp`) is working in
your environment under debug mode before using the chunks with D-TIME.
1. Please don't ignore files with name starting with `.` (`.funtab`, `.modtab`, etc.).
These files may not be visible in your file explorer by default.  
Check `View --> Show/hide --> Hidden items` to view them.
